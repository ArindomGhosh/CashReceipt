## Kotlin, MVI
In this I have tried to explore the conventional android APIs like viewmodel, livedata, coroutines and hilt, to 
behave like a Stateful UI, where whenever there is change in the API the affected UI graph is recreated.
It's an attempt to implement idea of State Management using conventional APIs.
